Metascience Design Lab - Project Team 2

Note: When working on a feature, your changes should be 
committed to a separate branch for that feature. When the feature is complete,
it can be merged into the master branch. When merge conflicts occur (as they inevitably will),
contact the person who made the changes which conflict with yours
to resolve the conflict in a way that doesn't break their code.
